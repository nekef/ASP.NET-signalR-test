# ASP.NET-signalR-test
ASP.NET Core SignalR is a library for adding real-time web functionality to apps. It allows server-side code to push updates to clients instantly, ideal for chat apps, live notifications, and more. SignalR handles connections, supports WebSockets, and falls back to other methods if needed, making it easy to build dynamic, interactive applications.
